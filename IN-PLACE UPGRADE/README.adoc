= Upgrading RHEL 7 to 8 with LEAPP and BOOM - LTO Show & Tell Series

== Description
This Show&Tell is aimed to share some of the most important concepts and actions needed for upgrading a RHEL 7 to RHEL 8.

Audience: IT Managers, Architects, IT security specialists and technical staff who operates Linux

:numbered:

== Introduction

This Show & Tell is intended to give system administrators information about leapp as a tool for assiting in the upgrading fromn RHEL 7 to RHEL 8 instances, with the minimal effort but with maximum security and a very short downtime window.

== Understand the environment and evaluate the pre-requisites.

An in-place upgrade is a recommended and supported way for migrating your system to the next major version of RHEL. This applies to RHEL 6 to RHEL 7 or RHEL 7 to RHEL 8 instances.

=== Applications

We need to understand, at first, the environment in terms of the applications installed. This is a very important step, mainly because after the upgrading process some packages and libraries will be depracated or changed in versions. Applications need to be analyzed under the light of what thay use of the operating system to run properly. Leapp pre-upgrade report is a good source of this kind of information, allowing the possibility to match the running application requierements with the possible changes the OS will experiment. In case of changes impacting the application, we need to take actions on this, that could go from modifying the application to install a new version of it.

=== Operating system and HW considerations.

Take a look of the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/html-single/upgrading_from_rhel_7_to_rhel_8/index#planning-an-upgrade_upgrading-from-rhel-7-to-rhel-8[requierements] needed to be considered for prepare the environment for the upgrading.

== Preparing a RHEL 7 system for the upgrade

=== Check instance is subscribed

Ensure the system is registered, if not you can use subscription-manager to do so.

[source,bash]
-----------------------------------------
subscription-manager register --auto-attach
-----------------------------------------

=== Check the current version and release of the running instance.

[source,bash]
-----------------------------------------
subscription-manager list --installed
+-------------------------------------------+
    Installed Product Status
+-------------------------------------------+
Product Name:   Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server
Product ID:     69
Version:        7.8
Arch:           x86_64
Status:         Not Subscribed
Status Details:
Starts:
Ends:
-----------------------------------------

In this example the version is 7.8 which is the last minor version of RHEL 7, at the moment this article was writen. In case we are not in the last minor version, we need to update the RHEL instance appropiately.

In some cases customers lock the updates to a specific versions. In this case we need to instruct the Subscription Manager to consume the latest content.

[source,bash]
-----------------------------------------
subscription-manager release --unset
yum versionlock clear
-----------------------------------------

=== Add the proper repositories

[source,bash]
-----------------------------------------
subscription-manager repos --enable rhel-7-server-rpms -enable rhel-7-server-extras-rpms
-----------------------------------------

=== Update the instance

Run yum to update the instance to the lasted update.

[source,bash]
-----------------------------------------
yum update -y
reboot
-----------------------------------------

=== Install LEAPP utility

Leapp is an OS and application modernization framework. In this case leapp is used for upgrading the OS from RHEL 7 to RHEL 8.

[source,bash]
-----------------------------------------
yum install leapp leapp-repository
-----------------------------------------

At this point we need to download additional required data files attached to the Knowledgebase https://access.redhat.com/articles/3664871[article] Data required by the Leapp utility for an in-place upgrade from RHEL 7 to RHEL 8 and place them in the /etc/leapp/files/ directory. This is necessary for a successful upgrade. Note that currently you need data files from the *leapp-data8.tar.gz* archive or later.

*NOTE:* we need to download the file *leapp-data8.tar.gz* using a browser, then uncompress it on  /etc/leapp/files

[source,bash]
-----------------------------------------
tar -xzf leapp-data8.tar.gz -C /etc/leapp/files && rm leapp-data8.tar.gz
-----------------------------------------

=== GRUB Considerations

If GRUB is installed outside of the default location, which is /boot, export the respective environment variable as follows:

[source,bash]
-----------------------------------------
export LEAPP_GRUB_DEVICE="/path_to_device"
-----------------------------------------

=== Automated tools considerations

Ensure you have any configuration management (such as Salt, Chef, Puppet, Ansible) disabled or adequately reconfigured to not attempt to restore the original RHEL 7 system.

=== Network Considerations

Ensure your system does not use more than one Network Interface Card (NIC) with a name based on the prefix used by the kernel *(eth)*.

=== Backup & Recovery Considerations

Ensure you have a full system backup or a virtual machine snapshot. you can use the https://access.redhat.com/solutions/2115051[Relax-and-Recover (ReaR) utility]. Alternatively, you can use https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/upgrading-rhel-7-rhel-8-leapp-and-boom[LVM snapshots using Boom], or RAID splitting.

== Pre-Upgrade reporting

Customers always can execute a pre-upgrade procedure that will analyze the instance and will create a report that can be visualized on text format. Alternatively customers can install webconsole on the server and the plugin for leapp. This will allow the customer to see a color coded  and easier to read report. Also from Webconsole they can execute the remediations leapp can advice in the pre-upgrade analysis.

[source,bash]
-----------------------------------------
yum install cockpit cockpit-leapp
systemctl enable --now cockpit.socket
-----------------------------------------

Then access the service using the server's ip and the port 9090 from any browser.

=== Executing the pre-upgrade analysis

After all components are installed and everything is configured correctly we are ready to generate the first report that exposes the analysis of leapp over the instance.

[source,bash]
-----------------------------------------
leapp preupgrade --debug

Upgrade has been inhibited due to the following problems:
    1. Inhibitor: Possible problems with remote login using root account
Consult the pre-upgrade report for details and possible remediation.

-----------------------------------------

As you can see in the output for this test environment there is one inhibitor.

*Upgrade has been inhibited due to the following problems:
    1. Inhibitor: Possible problems with remote login using root account. Consult the pre-upgrade report for details and possible remediation.*

There are a lot of inrmation in the report that we will be showing with webconsole. For now we need to understand how to fix the inhibition to proceed with the upgrade process.

[source,bash]
-----------------------------------------
cat /var/log/leapp/leapp-report.txt

... output omited for space sake!

Risk Factor: high (inhibitor)
Title: Possible problems with remote login using root account
Summary: OpenSSH configuration file does not explicitly state the option PermitRootLogin in sshd_config file, which will default in RHEL8 to "prohibit-password".
Remediation: [hint] If you depend on remote root logins using passwords, consider setting up a different user for remote administration or adding "PermitRootLogin yes" to sshd_config.

... output omited for space sake!
-----------------------------------------

As we can see, we need to explicitly permit root login on this instance. Doing it it is very straighforward.

[source,bash]
-----------------------------------------
vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config

.... uncomment the line
#PermitRootLogin yes
-----------------------------------------

=== The report from webconsole

The report can be accessed using a webconsole plugin called cockpit-leapp with conveniently show a color coded report with more detailed information in a human readible format.

image::leapp_webconsole_report.png[]

A color code and some values can give us enough information about leapp findings.

* Risk factor
** High - very likely to result in a deteriorated system state
** Medium - can impact both the system and applications
** Low - should not impact the system but can have an impact on applications

* Inhibitor - will inhibit (hard stop) the upgrade process, otherwise the system could become unbootable, inaccessible, or dysfunctional

* Remediation - an actionable solution to a reported problem:
** Remediation command - can be executed directly through the web console
** Remediation hint - instructions on how to resolve the problem manually

In this report, a remediation hint is proposed for the inhibitor rule, which is uncomment "PermitRootLogin yes", as described above.

This report can be seen as a pre-flight check, where valuable information is listed for taking actions on applications on the system.

In this report, for example, we can see in the first two lines that some packages are not going to be installed on the upgraded instance. We can check which packages are not going to be installed just clicking on the links, as you can see in the next image.

image::leapp_webconsole_report-packagesnotinstalled.png[]

A customer must assess which packakes and libraries an application is accessing from the OS, so determining if the packages not installed or updated to newer versions could impact the normal functioning of the application, though the services.

After executing remediations, generate the pre-upgrade report again by using the leapp preupgrade command, examine the new report, and take additional remediation steps if needed.

== Ready for pre-upgrade phase

=== Phase 1

After all pre-requisites are met and all remediation hints are applied, we are ready to execute leapp for upgrading the RHEL instance.

In this phase Leapp downloads necessary data and prepares an RPM transaction for the upgrade. If your system does not meet the parameters for a reliable upgrade, Leapp terminates the upgrade process and provides a record describing the issue and a recommended solution in the /var/log/leapp/leapp-report.txt file.

-----------------------------------------

In this example, leapp hace pre-uprade the instancew generating a report accessible at /var/log/leapp/leapp-report.txt

We need now to reboot the system at this point.

=== Phase 2

image::leapp_phaseII.png[]

In this phase, the system boots into a RHEL 8-based initial RAM disk image, initramfs. Leapp upgrades all packages and automatically reboots to the RHEL 8 system.

Alternatively, you can run the leapp upgrade command with the --reboot option and skip this manual step.

image::leapp_phaseII-proceed1.png[]

image::leapp_phaseII-proceed2.png[]

Several reboots are going to happen.

image::leapp_phaseII-proceed4.png[]

After upgrade and configure, a reboot is executed automatically at the end of the process. After this we need to check is everything is ok and the version of the atrget system is as expected.

== Checking the upgraded instance

=== Release installed

[source,bash]
-----------------------------------------
cat /etc/redhat-release
Red Hat Enterprise Linux release 8.2 (Ootpa)
-----------------------------------------

[source,bash]
-----------------------------------------
uname -r
4.18.0-193.el8.x86_64
-----------------------------------------

[source,bash]
-----------------------------------------
uname -r
4.18.0-193.el8.x86_64
-----------------------------------------

[source,bash]
-----------------------------------------
# subscription-manager list --installed
+-----------------------------------------+
    	  Installed Product Status
+-----------------------------------------+
Product Name: Red Hat Enterprise Linux for x86_64
Product ID:   479
Version:      8.2
Arch:         x86_64
Status:       Subscribed
-----------------------------------------

[source,bash]
-----------------------------------------
subscription-manager release
Release: 8.2
-----------------------------------------

Note that when the release version is set to 8.2, customer will be receiving yum updates only for this specific version of RHEL. If customer wants to unset the release version to be able to consume updates from the latest minor version of RHEL 8, use the following command:

[source,bash]
-----------------------------------------
subscription-manager release --unset
-----------------------------------------

== Restore SELinux enforcing mode

During the in-place upgrade process, certain security policies must remain disabled. Such is the case of SELinux which leapp changes the mode to permissive from the beginning of the process. We need to change it to enforce mode after the upgrading process.

Ensure that there are no SELinux denials, for example, by using the ausearch utility:

[source,bash]
-----------------------------------------
ausearch -m AVC,USER_AVC -ts boot

<no matches>
-----------------------------------------

Now change the SELinux configuration editing /etc/selinux/config

[source,bash]
-----------------------------------------
vim /etc/selinux/config

# This file controls the state of SELinux on the system.
# SELINUX= can take one of these three values:
#       enforcing - SELinux security policy is enforced.
#       permissive - SELinux prints warnings instead of enforcing.
#       disabled - No SELinux policy is loaded.
SELINUX=enforcing
# SELINUXTYPE= can take one of these two values:
#       targeted - Targeted processes are protected,
#       mls - Multi Level Security protection.
SELINUXTYPE=targeted
-----------------------------------------

Then 

[source,bash]
-----------------------------------------
reboot
-----------------------------------------

After the rebooting process let´s check the result.

[source,bash]
-----------------------------------------
getenforce
  Enforcing
-----------------------------------------

At this point our server is up to date to the lates RHEL 8 minor version.

== Snapshooting an instance to boot aternatively using boom

One way to recover for a failed or not consistent upgrading process is creating a bootable snapshot with the last image just before starting the upgrading process.

== Check logical volumes and disk groups

[source,bash]
-----------------------------------------
 lvs
  LV       VG   Attr       LSize   Pool Origin Data%  Meta%  Move Log Cpy%Sync Convert
  root     rhel owi-aos--- <12.50g
  swap     rhel -wi-ao----   1.50g

vgs
  VG   #PV #LV #SN Attr   VSize  VFree
  rhel   2   3   1 wz--n- 28.99g <2.45g
-----------------------------------------

== Snapshot creation

Create a snapshot called *rollback* with the following command.

[source,bash]
-----------------------------------------
lvcreate -s -L 13G -n rollback rhel/root 

 Reducing COW size 12.55 GiB down to maximum usable size <12.55 GiB.
 Logical volume "rollback" created.
-----------------------------------------

Now check what we have done.

[source,bash]
-----------------------------------------
lvs 
  
  LV       VG   Attr       LSize   Pool Origin Data%  Meta%  Move Log Cpy%Sync Convert
  rollback rhel swi-a-s--- <12.55g      root   37.21
  root     rhel owi-aos--- <12.50g
  swap     rhel -wi-ao----   1.50g
-----------------------------------------

=== Creating the bootable rollback snapshot with boom

[source,bash]
-----------------------------------------
boom create --title "RHEL7.8 Snapshot for rollback" --rootlv rhel/rollback

WARNING - Boom configuration not found in grub.cfg
WARNING - Run 'grub2-mkconfig > /boot/grub2/grub.cfg' to enable
Created entry with boot_id 94bb475:

 linux /vmlinuz-3.10.0-957.el7.x86_64
 initrd /initramfs-3.10.0-957.el7.x86_64.img
 options root=/dev/rhel/rollback ro rd.lvm.lv=rhel/rollback rhgb quiet
-----------------------------------------

We need to copy the configuration so the grub menu reflects this new entry.

[source,bash]
-----------------------------------------
grub2-mkconfig > /boot/grub2/grub.cfg

Generating grub configuration file ...
Found linux image: /boot/vmlinuz-3.10.0-957.el7.x86_64

Found initrd image: /boot/initramfs-0-rescue-aff60dca5fb14737858604118a273715.img
done
-----------------------------------------

Now we can check if we have a new image from booting of.

[source,bash]
-----------------------------------------
boom list
BootID  Version                 Name RootDevice
cf9fd6d 3.10.0-957.el7.x86_64    Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server /dev/rhel/rollback
-----------------------------------------

After this simple prcedure we are ready to start the upgrading process as described in previous sections.

Rebooting the system after the upgrading process the GRUB menu will look like the following.

image::leapp_boom1.png[]

We can choose from booting from the upgraded RHEL or from the snapshot taken just before the upgrading process.

== How we can Upgrade from RHEL 6 to 7?

Doing this upgrade on RHEL 6 have the same logic and steps but some commands are going to be different. 

=== Prepare the system to be candidate to be upgraded.

In the same way we did on RHEL 7, we need to bring the instance to the latest minor version, which is 6.10.

[source,bash]
-----------------------------------------
yum update -y 
reboot
-----------------------------------------

=== Add the proper RHEL 6 repositories

We need to add the repositories and install the software needed.

[source,bash]
-----------------------------------------
subscription-manager repos --enable rhel-6-server-extras-rpms
subscription-manager repos --enable rhel-6-server-optinal-rpms
-----------------------------------------

=== Installing the software for RHEL 6 upgrade

[source,bash]
-----------------------------------------
yum -y install preupgrade-assistant preupgrade-assistant-ui preupgrade-assistant-el6toel7 redhat-upgrade-tool
-----------------------------------------

=== Assessment

The upgrade tool can be used previous to the upgrade process itself. This could help the customer to understan a little bit better its environment and what things are going to change between versions. This could help to evaluate if the application that runs on the RHEL 6 instance can be moved to RHEL 7 without compromising its stability and quality of service.

Also, in this assessment the customer can evaluate the inhibitors for the upgrading. Those inhibitors can be fixed or remediated to take a step on the upgrading process.

[source,bash]
-----------------------------------------
preupg -v
-----------------------------------------

=== Upgrading process

If the customer addresses all the inhibitors and the applications are candidates for this migration process, the only thing left to execute the upgrade.

It is needed to instruct  the tool where are the repositories needed for the upgrading procedure. In this case, we need to indicate where are all the binaries and sources of RHEL 7.6, which is the version to upgrade.

In this example I have downloaded the RHEL 7.6 DVD image, so we need to mount the DVD on the instance and poit out to the device.

[source,bash]
-----------------------------------------
mkdir /media/dvd
mount /dev/sr0 /media/dvd
-----------------------------------------

There are other methos that can be used. The following https://access.redhat.com/solutions/637583[article] give details about this.

Now we can proceed with the upgrade itself.

[source,bash]
-----------------------------------------
redhat-upgrade-tool --device /dev/sr0 --cleanup-post
reboot
-----------------------------------------

=== Check the upgraded instance

Once the upgrade procedure is done we need to check the version. But most importantly, we need to update the instance to the last RHEL 7 minor version if we pretend to upgrade to RHEL 8.2.

[source,bash]
-----------------------------------------
more /etc/redhat-release
-----------------------------------------

Also we can check which repositories are enabled.

[source,bash]
-----------------------------------------
yum repolist
-----------------------------------------

=== Upgrading to GRUB 2

RHEL 6 uses GRUB v1. RHEL 7 and 8 use GRUB v2. We can left version 1 installed as is, but if we want to upgrade to RHEL 8, we must upgrade GRUB to version 2. 

==== Install the software

[source,bash]
-----------------------------------------
yum install grub2 grub2-tools grubby
-----------------------------------------

==== Determine which disk

It is important to double check in which disk is going to be installed grub.

[source,bash]
-----------------------------------------
grub2-install /dev/sda
-----------------------------------------

==== Create the grub file

Just copy and paste this block.

[source,bash]
-----------------------------------------
cat >/etc/default/grub <<EOF
GRUB_TIMEOUT=5
GRUB_DISTRIBUTOR="\$(sed 's, release .*$,,g' /etc/system-release)"
GRUB_DEFAULT=saved
GRUB_DISABLE_SUBMENU=true
GRUB_TERMINAL_OUTPUT="console"
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="$(grep '^\s*kernel /vmlinuz-3' /boot/grub/grub.conf | head -1 | sed -r -e 's,^\s*kernel /vmlinuz\S+ ,,' -e 's,\<root=\S+ ,,' -e 's,\<ro ,,')"
GRUB_DISABLE_RECOVERY="true"
EOF
-----------------------------------------

It should be look this way.

[source,bash]
-----------------------------------------
cat /etc/default/grub
GRUB_TIMEOUT=5
GRUB_DISTRIBUTOR="$(sed 's, release .*$,,g' /etc/system-release)"
GRUB_DEFAULT=saved
GRUB_DISABLE_SUBMENU=true
GRUB_TERMINAL_OUTPUT="console"
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="rd.lvm.lv=vg_hostname/lv_root rd.lvm.lv=vg_hostname/lv_swap crashkernel=auto quiet"
GRUB_DISABLE_RECOVERY="true"
-----------------------------------------

==== Buld the grub file

[source,bash]
-----------------------------------------
grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg
-----------------------------------------

Then reboot.

=== Upgrading to RHEL 8.2

If we plan to upgrade to version 8 (which is the recommendation) it is needed to update to the last RHEL 7 minor version. In this case, the procedure described above just bring us to 7.6 version. We need to update to 7.8 version. From now on, we can do the upgrading process using the same procedure described in this document, used for upgrading from RHEL 7 to RHEL 8.
