= Securing Linux Servers and auditing security policies with OpenSCAP - LTO Show & Tell Series

== Description
This Show&Tell is aimed to share some of the most important concepts and features of OpenSCAP as a tool for auditing security policies.

Audience: IT Managers, Architects, IT security specialists and technical staff who operates Linux

:numbered:

== Introduction

This Show & Tell is intended to give to system administrators a brief introduction to openSCAP. We will describe the tools, how to install it on a Linux environment as RHEL, how to interact with the tool from scanning to remediation. Also we will discussing the integrarion with the RHEL predictive tool called Insights.

Let's start!

== What is OpenSCAP?

OpenSCAP is a group of security tools, standards and policies for performing security compliance checks against the systems by following SCAP, which is the U.S. standard maintained by NIST. The SCAP scanner, which is an engine, reads a security policy and checks whether the system is compliant with it. It goes through out all of the rules defined in the policy, one by one, and reports whether each rule is fulfilled. If all checks pass, the system is compliant with the security policy. If not, the system isn't complaint and need a remediation, that can be executed through scripts or ansible playbooks or letting the tool to remediate each non compliant rule.

== Using OpenSCAP

=== The OpenSCAP oscap command line utility

This utility enables us to scan systems validating security compliance content and generating reports and guides based on the scans and evaluations made. This is the front end to the OpenSCAP library and groups.

--------------------------

After copy the security guides updated in /usr/share/xml/scap/ssg/content/ directory, we can get info from these guides to see if profiles are changed. This is done using the 'info' dirc eof oscap described in the next section.

=== Getting info for using oscap

The oscap utility can process files conforming to many of the formats used by the utility. In order to process the given file with SCAP content, we need to understand how to use oscap with the given file type. We can open and read the file, or use the info module of oscap which parses the file and extracts relevant information in human-readable format.

for example, let´s see the content of ssg-rhel8-ds.xml and ssg-rhel8-ds.xml

[source, bash]

------------------------

Now we can see a lot more guides for our RHEL 8 instance.

=== Scanning a host

The oscap utility can scan systems against the SCAP content represented by both an XCCDF (The eXtensible Configuration Checklist Description Format) benchmark and OVAL (Open Vulnerability and Assessment Language) definitions. The security policy can be in the form of a single OVAL or XCCDF file or multiple separate XML files where each file represents a different component (XCCDF, OVAL, CPE, CVE, and others). The result of a scan can be printed to both standard output and an XML file. The result file can then be further processed by oscap in order to generate a report in a human-readable format. 

For this exercise we are going to scan the system first, using a SSCDF, no remediations will executed int this very first step. We need to understand how far we are to comply with the profile selected.

By the time we wrote this Show & Tell documentation, RHEL 8 had two possible profiles available.

Title: *Protection Profile for General Purpose Operating Systems*
   Id: xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_profile_ospp
Title: *PCI-DSS v3.2.1 Control Baseline for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8*
   Id: xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_profile_pci-dss

Let´s scan with protection profile for general purpose OS. We also could chck the system using the pci-dss profile. In both cases, the profile defines de baseline to be acomplished. The oscap can help us to evealuate how far the system is from the profile selected.

[source, bash]
-------------------------
# oscap xccdf eval --profile xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_profile_ospp \
--results scan-xccdf-results.xml \
--report  scan-xccdf-results.html \
/usr/share/xml/scap/ssg/content/ssg-rhel8-ds.xml \
| tee scan-xccdf-results.txt
-------------------------

* oscap xccdf eval will evaluate the system using the xccdf file format.
* --profile select the general purpose server profile.
* --report send a human readable report to scan-xccdf-results.html.
* --results build a results file scan-xccdf-results.xml.
* /usr/share/xml/scap/ssg/content/ssg-rhel8-ds.xml get the RHEL 8 data stream to execute the scanning process. 
* The stardar output is redirected to a file using the *tee* command.

An excerpt of the output is shown using a simple *more* command.

=== Making remediations

OpenSCAP allows to automatically remediate systems that have been found in a non-compliant state. For system remediation, an XCCDF file with instructions is required. The scap-security-guide package contains certain remediation instructions.

System remediation consists of the following steps:

* OpenSCAP performs a regular XCCDF evaluation.
* An assessment of the results is performed by evaluating the OVAL definitions. Each rule that has failed is marked as a candidate for remediation.
* OpenSCAP searches for an appropriate fix element, resolves it, prepares the environment, and executes the fix script.
* Any output of the fix script is captured by OpenSCAP and stored within the rule-result element. The return value of the fix script is stored as well.
* Whenever OpenSCAP executes a fix script, it immediatelly evaluates the OVAL definition again (to verify that the fix script has been applied correctly). During this second run, if the OVAL evaluation returns success, the result of the rule is fixed, otherwise it is an error.
* Detailed results of the remediation are stored in an output XCCDF file. It contains two TestResult elements. The first TestResult element represents the scan prior to the remediation. The second TestResult is derived from the first one and contains remediation results.

There are three modes of operation of OpenSCAP with regard to remediation: online, offline, and review.

==== Online Remediation

Online remediation executes fix elements at the time of scanning. Evaluation and remediation are performed as a part of a single command.

[source, bash]
-----------------------
# oscap xccdf eval --remediate \
--profile xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_profile_ospp \
--results scan-xccdf-remediation.xml \
--report  scan-xccdf-remediation.html \
/usr/share/xml/scap/ssg/content/ssg-rhel8-ds.xml \
| tee scan-xccdf-remediation.txt
-----------------------

With scan-xccdf-remediation.txt file we can get a petit report with each rule and the result of the remeditation procedure.

[source, bash]
-----------------------
# sed -e '1,/Starting Remediation/d' scan-xccdf-remediation.txt | egrep '(Title|Result)' |  awk '{if (NR%2) {printf("%s", $0)} else {printf " --> (%s)\n",$2} } '| cut -f2- > scan-xccdf-remediation-report.txt

# more scan-xccdf-remediation-report.txt

Disable SSH Root Login --> (fixed)
Enable SSH Warning Banner --> (fixed)

Install usbguard Package --> (error)
Authorize USB hubs in USBGuard daemon --> (fixed)
Log USBGuard daemon audit events using Linux Audit --> (fixed)
Authorize Human Interface Devices in USBGuard daemon --> (fixed)
Configure auditd to use audispd's syslog plugin --> (fixed)
Configure audit according to OSPP requirements --> (fixed)
...
-----------------------

==== Offline Remediation

Offline remediation allows us to postpone fix execution. In the first step, the system is only evaluated, and the results are stored in a TestResult element in an XCCDF file.

[source, bash]
-----------------------
# oscap xccdf eval \
--profile xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_profile_ospp \
--results scan-xccdf-remediation.xml \
--report  scan-xccdf-remediation.html \
/usr/share/xml/scap/ssg/content/ssg-rhel8-ds.xml \
| tee scan-xccdf-remediation.txt
-----------------------

Then we can performa the remediations using scan-xccdf-remediation.xml file.

[source, bash]
-----------------------
# oscap xccdf remediate --results scan-xccdf-remediation.html scan-xccdf-remediation.html
-----------------------

==== Evaluation Remediation

The review mode enables us to store remediation instructions to a file for further review. The remediation content is not executed during this operation.

In this example we are generating a remediation-script.sh file.

[source, bash]
-----------------------
# oscap xccdf generate fix --template urn:xccdf:fix:script:sh \
--profile xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_profile_ospp \
--output remediation-script.sh --fetch-remote-resources \
/usr/share/xml/scap/ssg/content/ssg-rhel8-ds.xml
-----------------------

The remediation-script.sh file looks like the following.

[source, bash]
-----------------------
# more remediation-script.sh

=== Scanning the RHEL infrastructure with OpenSCAP Workbench

SCAP Workbench is a graphical user interface for the SCAP toolset that was designed to provide users with an intuitive GUI for performing scanning and remediation tasks. The SCAP Workbench is a graphical tool and in many environments where Linux servers are running headless without the graphical X environment installed we need to forward X11.

SCAP Workbench is a cross-platform application, with downloads available for Windows, macOS, and most common Linux platforms, therefore, the easiest path for most users will be to run it in their native operating system. If, for consistency, you wish to run SCAP Workbench on Linux, you would either need to set up a remote X11 session or set up a dedicated scanning host that includes the graphical desktop environment.

On RHEL We need to install all packages required by SCAP Workbench to function properly, including the scap-workbench package that provides the utility itself. Note that required dependencies, such as the qt and openssh packages, are automatically updated to the newest available version if the packages are already installed on our system.

SCAP Workbench needs a security content to operate. Red Hat recommends to use the SCAP Security Guide (SSG) thet we have installed already.

[source, bash]
-----------------------
# sudo yum -y install scap-workbench
-----------------------

We can download a installer for Windows or MAC if you feel more confortable for running this application in your native operating system. No matter where we executes the workbench, we can scan servers remotely.

Afrter the execution of scap-workbench the first thing we have to select are the profiles for the specific operating system of the server we are suposed to scan.

image::loadSecurityGuide.png[]

In case we don't find the operating system or version needed for the server to be scanned, we can download the latest security guide, as described in a previous section, and select other *Other SCAP content*, then load content to select the appropriate file.

We must select a profile the scanning process. In our example we are going to select the *StandardSystem Security Profile for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8*.

image::workbenchChooseProfile.png[]

We can scan all the rules proposed, but also we can customize what best fit our requirements. Select *Customize* for modify what rules are going to be scanned.

image::workbenchCustomize.png[]

We can desellect all rules for selecting just what we need to apply to our server.

image::workbenchSelectRules.png[]

After selecting the rules that apply to our organization we can initiate a *remediation* for the server we need to set in compliance the customized (or full) security guide.

Select the *Remediation* button for execute all the fixes needed for set the server compliance.

The tool, as in command line, execute a scanning first.

image::workbenchRemediationScanning.png[]

Then, select all failed candidates to execute a fix on each rule.

image::workbenchRemediationScanning-2.png[]

After the remediation all the fixes are shown.

Also, we van select the *Report* button to see in a browser the rport just created.

image::workbenchReport.png[]

In this report we can also see the details of each rule.

== Integrating report to Insights

We can integrate the reports result of periodic scanning or remediations with Ansible, using the command line.

[source, bash]
-------------------------
